# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on age, annual income, and spending behavior. The project includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the application of the KMeans clustering algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the distribution of key features such as age, annual income, and spending score.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to group customers based on their features.
- **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations, including scatter plots and a dashboard, to effectively communicate insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Utilize Plotly and Dash to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing customer segments.
